**Entropy UI** simplifies your projects with easy integration, offering a collection of components you can seamlessly **drop in**. Looking ahead, we aim to enhance its functionality and dependencies based on user feedback. So, while it currently simplifies your projects with straightforward integration, it's poised to evolve and adapt to meet your specific UI development needs.

While some components may incorporate additional libraries for specific features, these are not mandatory during the initial installation. Details about any optional libraries will be provided on the respective component pages as needed.
